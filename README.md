// Peer Comment : The project is nice and simple code runs good and evrything. the only thing is the spaceing in the first page between the three characters in the figma is spcaed out differently than in the html page. and some of the text as well are different between the two. the spacing as well with the text is off between the two . overall good design and good work.
